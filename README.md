## Reflection

This project took me almost a month to complete due to a high standard I set for myself because I made the output of an experienced developer to be the inspiration for my implementation for this project, which is a project in The Odin Project to allow learners to appy what they have learned in React. Being my first React project, with a high standard, it was overwhelming. But persistence allowed me to persevere and finish the project.

What made this project really challenging is the fact that I did not learn Tailwind at this point. I realized that the reference project was using Tailwinmd CSS for styling components easier, and I did not know any better and just used plain old CSS and wasted a lot of time coming up class names and having to use inline styles most of the time. 

Another challenge to point out was the transitions of the reference I tried to imitate in my project. Having to style transitions between accordions, while considering whether a section was opened or not and ensuring that the opened section remain while going between accordions.

At the end of the day, it was a really fun and super challenging project for someone like me who just learned React. I may not have made the best React code with this one, and I am aware of how messy it is, but I learned a lot from this. It was a good learning experience.
